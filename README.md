# CS160-Project

The project requires downloading xampp with a php server and a MySQL database initiated for the database (which we called broquedb), 
and requires adding schema to a table called accounts (username of type text, password of type text, phone number of type int, and name of type text). T
he php files need to be placed into a folder called broquedb, and then the database needs to be connected through the localhost. 
The user interface can be downloaded from github and run on android studio. Master branch is runnable without xampp.
